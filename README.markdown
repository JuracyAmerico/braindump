# braindump: low-tech dump of my neurons

- It's not a SciFi/high-tech thing, don't be excited (sorry);
- It's not a software project;
- It's just for me (but you can read/access if you want to).

By low-tech I mean **using a keyboard** (a good one, preferably).


## What?

This is a not-so-structured space where I put information I want to publish and
access in the future, even if it does not fit a blog post, an item on a list
etc. It's just a Git repository with a bunch of markdown files.

If you suffer from:

- The **many-open-tabs syndrome** (having dozens of open tabs on
  your Web browser -- and you open *another* browser when need to navigate),
- The **many-loose-lists syndrome**, or
- The **I-email-myself syndrome**

and you are familiar with Git and markdown, then you can organize your
information like this (or just open *another tab group*  -- on Firefox,
Ctrl+E).


## What Kind of Information?

- Anything I want to read but don't have time now (so a list of links);
- A "digested" series of information (text snippets written by me, links etc.)
  by a subject of interest.

This would be useful to share some information even if I don't have time to
write a proper text to blog/send to somebody, to list "good practices" about
something I've read, my opinions about a topic etc.


## Which Language?

English, Portuguese or anything I can read and write and want to use in the
moment (sorry, but I'm not worried about you -- this is for me).


## May I Help?

For sure! If you want to contribute or comment about something, please create a
pull request, a comment on some file/line/commit etc.


## How to Structure Files

Just create a markdown file about the subject and put information on it.
Nothing more than that.


## Why Not a Wiki Software?

Convenience: I prefer to edit text files using my text editor and Git for
version control as I use it daily for programming.


## Why Not to Blog About Each Topic?

The information does not necessarily need to be structured in a proper text for
posting on a blog. It's just a place to store something I'll access later on.
On the other hand, many topics/files probably will evolve in a way it can be
posted on a blog (there's no rule anyway).
