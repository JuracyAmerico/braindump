## Infrastructure-as-a-service

- [DigitalOcean](http://bit.ly/docloud) -- SSD-only VPSes (if you need more space than the VPS have, you're going to have a bad time)
- [Server4You VPS](http://www.server4you.com/vps/) -- good cost/benefit and have SSD
- [Wable](https://wable.com/) -- very cost-effective for tiny instances (starts from US$0.75/month for 1 VPS)

## Dedicated-server

- [OVH](https://www.ovh.com/) (and its "brothers" [KimSufi](https://www.kimsufi.com/en/) and [So You Start](http://www.soyoustart.com/)) -- one of the best dedicated server regarding cost/benefit, they have 15 datacenters in France and Canada. The support is not that good, unfortunately.
